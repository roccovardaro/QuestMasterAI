    "quest_description": "In a whimsical forest, Ulfric the dramatically incompetent wolf attempts repeatedly to catch Lillo the lamb, who is surprisingly articulate and enjoys critiquing Ulfric's hunting techniques.",
    "initial_state": "Ulfric, a wolf with a flair for the dramatic but lacking in hunting prowess, spots Lillo, a lamb engrossed in gourmet grass-tasting, completely unaware of the impending (and comically doomed) chase.",
    "goal": "Ulfric's primary goal is to successfully capture and consume Lillo. Lillo's goal is to expertly evade Ulfric while simultaneously providing unsolicited, often scathing, culinary and physical fitness advice.",
    "obstacles": [
        "Lillo's unparalleled agility and his ability to distract Ulfric with verbose, food-related commentary.",
        "Ulfric's profound clumsiness, which leads him to trip, slide, and generally fail in slapstick fashion.",
        "The natural environment (mud puddles, thorny bushes, tangled vines) frequently becomes an accidental impediment for Ulfric.",
        "Ulfric's susceptibility to Lillo's critiques, making him self-conscious and less focused on the hunt."
